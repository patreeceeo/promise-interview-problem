# What is this?

Use this repository to test a candidate's JavaScript chops. Each branch contains failing specs that build upon each other. Have the candidate merge in one branch to "master" at a time, making the failing specs pass along the way. This way you can, if you wish, bring more of a collaborative spirit to the interview and let the computer tell them when they're messing up.
